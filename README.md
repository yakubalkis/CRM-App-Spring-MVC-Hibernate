# CRM-App-SpringMVC-Hibernate
It is a very basic CRM app. The first web app that I've made using the Spring framework. <br>
This project has been made by using Spring MVC and Hibernate. Spring AOP was used for logging.<br>
MySQL server was used for database processes. CRUD operations can be applied in this project. <br>

## Requirements
- User can create a new customer, also delete or update the customer.
